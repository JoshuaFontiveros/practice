                        <h3>Main Ingredients for Beef In Creamy Mushroom Sauce </h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Beef - </strong>The recipe calls for sirloin which you can cut into thin slices, strips, or cubes</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Mushrooms - </strong>I used canned whole mushrooms, but feel free to swap with fresh button or cremini mushrooms. <br/>Just slice and cook a little longer during the first step of the recipe.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>All-Purpose Cream - </strong>you can substitute with heavy cream, evaporated milk, or sour cream.</p></li>

                        <h3>Instructions</h3>
                        <ol type = "A">
                            <li>Cut the beef across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices.</li>
                            <li>In a bowl, season beef with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                            <li>In a wide pan over medium-high heat, heat about 1 tablespoon oil. Add mushrooms and cook for about 30 seconds. Remove from pan and keep warm.</li>
                            <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan if needed. Add beef in a single layer and sear for about 2 to 3 minutes per side or until lightly browned. Do not overcrowd pan, cook beef in batches as needed. Remove meat from the pan and keep warm.</li>
                            <li>In the pan, add the butter.</li>
                            <li>When melted, add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
                            <li>Add flour and continue to cook, stirring regularly, for about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Gradually add broth, whisking regularly to prevent lumps.</li>
                            <li>Add beef. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that floats on top. Lower heat, cover, and simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until meat is fork-tender. Add more broth or water in 1/2 cup increments if the liquid is getting too thick before the meat is fully tender.</li>
                            <li>Add all-purpose cream and stir to distribute. Season with salt and pepper to taste. </li>
                            <li>Add mushrooms. Continue to cook for another 1 to 2 minutes or until mushrooms are heated through. Serve hot.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2>Notes</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For a more tender chew, slice the beef across the grain. You can freeze the meat for about 20 minutes or until partially firm to make slicing easier.</li>
                            <li>For extra depth of flavor, use condensed cream of mushroom soup. Reconstitute a 10-ounce can with the beef broth and omit the cream.</li>
                        </ul>
