                    <h3>MANILA, Philippines - Are you mad about instigating change?</h3>
                    <p>From a simple outreach project in December 2009, youth organization <u>I Am M A D</u> has since touched the lives of 1,420 students in 32 areas across the Philippines.</p>
                    <p>The organization holds retreats and leadership camps for children to make them realize their potential to create change in their communities.</p>
                    <p>Christian Marx Rivero, I Am MAD co-founder said:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Our definition of change is the impact you have on yourself, how you are changed. Change really begins with yourself. When you are able to change yourself, that's what <br> 
                            we can call change.</p>
                        <p>This is why we encourage the youth to make a difference in their own simplest way, to create a difference in any way.</p>    
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Fueled by volunteerism</h3>
                    <p>I Am MAD functions purely out of volunteerism. The organization doesn't have its own funds. <q>A big impact of I Am MAD is our volunteers. We have around 200 to 300 volunteers<br>
                    all over the country... Volunteers even pay to become part of the organization. The hearts of our volunteers are really what creates the change,</q> Rivero said.</p>
